# Build the hot sauce list
## Build instructions
1. run "npm install" in terminal
2. run "npm run start"
3. Open up localhost:8000 in your browser

## Overview
Hello awesome candidate! You will be building the amazing hot sauce list. The list will contain rows of hot sauces that shows a picture and title in each row. Each row will be clickable and navigate you to that rows hot sauce details view. The details view will show the picture, title, description, and extra details about the hot sauce. The goal of this project is to see how far you can go. We understand you may not be familiar with some of the required technologies and that’s okay. We want you to do the best you can.

We will be providing two mockup files that you will be basing your project on. The mockup itself contains a design for the list page and the details page. In this project is already a sample index.html file with some starter code to get going.

During the project you will be using a combination of JavaScript, ReactJS, JSON, CSS and HTML to construct the list.  All the data for the list will come from hotsauces.json and contains data for the list and for the details page.

## Requirements
**Stick to just JavaScript, Reactjs, CSS, and HTML.**
We would like if you would stick to these technologies only, we understand that jQuery or Bootstrap might feel easier in some cases but for this project let’s keep it simple and stick with plain CSS, Reactjs, and JavaScript.

**Each hot sauce when clicked will take you to its respective details page.**
This is pretty self-explanatory but bonus points if you load the details of a hot sauce on the same page without traveling to a new html file/page.

**It will look like the design**
We know the design is not the best design in the universe but we would like if you came the same overall look and feel in order to complete the project.

**The list and details page must be loaded in from the hotsauce.json file provided.**
It might seem pretty easy to just past the list in but we want you to load in the JSON file via Ajax request and generate the list with Reactjs.

**Fork the project on github**
We would like if you would fork the public project on Github and email us the link to it when you are done.

## Notes and potential issues
Because this is react make sure you are viewing this web project through a web server (localhost/HotSauceTest/index.html) as an example. If you open index.html through the file system React and the project will not work.
